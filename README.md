# Task1_textsummary

## Overview

This project is about automatically summarizing long pieces of text into shorter, meaningful summaries using Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to help users quickly understand important information without reading everything.

For example:

**Original Text**  
"Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing industries such as healthcare, education, finance, and manufacturing. With its ability to analyze large datasets, make predictions, and learn from outcomes, AI is helping doctors detect diseases earlier, automating business processes, and providing personalized learning experiences. Despite its benefits, AI raises ethical concerns around bias, job loss, and data privacy, which require careful regulation and oversight."

**Summary**  
"AI is transforming industries and improving tasks, but it also brings ethical concerns like bias and privacy."
